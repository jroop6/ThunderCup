-------Bugs-------
fix multiplayer de-synch problems
    transferInOrbs are not being put onto the orbArray nor being removed from the transferInOrbs list. debug the snapTransferOrbs method in PlayPanel
chat box sometimes isn't accessible in GameScene... but only sometimes. Wut?

-------important features-------
load manual puzzles
implement the Vs Computer game mode
when a game begins, the program should move the camera so that it is centered on your character and maybe have some visual flourish indicate which character is yours.
character animations
character voices/sound effects
respond to defeat and victory conditions
smarter bots

-------moderate refactoring-------
use a hashmap for the transferInOrbs instead of a list, for easier consistency checking.
Consider using Orbs instead of PointInts for depth-first search and other related methods.
The entire tick() method of PlayPanel should probably be relocated to PlayPanelData.
	actually, there are elements that make more sense to be in PlayPanel, such as VisualFlourishes and calls to animationTick. Think about this carefully. 
combine animation enums into 1 file instead of 3 (exception for orbImages)
There are 2 copies of numPlayers - one in PlayPanel and one in PlayPanelData. Reduce it to just 1 instance.

-------polish-------
Add a pause *button*
implement a visual effect for thunder orbs
reduce volume of music, and normalize all tracks
cannon moving parts have too small a hole - it is only 45 px wide instead of 46. Why I made it that way is beyond me. It even messes up the symmetry of the stationary parts. It's a lot of work for very little benefit, so this is low priority.
add a progress bar at the top, indicating how many shots the player has left until a new row appears.
Add a new feature/game mode - controlling multiple cannons.
Make multiplayer games easier for non-techie people to set up.

-------cleanup and loose ends-------
replace i++ with ++i in for-loops (does this even make a difference in Java?)
add links to CC licenses in credits for audio assets
    while I'm at it, make sure the audio credits are complete and correct.
redo all spritesheets to make sure that transparent pixels are actually cropped out.
	It will also change _metadata.csv to spritesheet_metadata.csv, which is better.
make sure all array traversals traverse i first then j, for memory performance reasons.
make sure I'm not using PointInt or Point.Double more often than I need to (you only need to when a function needs to return both an x-value and a y-value, such as with IJtoXY())
remove low-res spritesheets; they're not necessary any more.
remove thunder orbs if I decide not to use them after all

-------misc-------
If memory becomes a problem again, consider other ways to reduce memory usage:
	use an in-memory compression scheme. Look at 3rd party libraries if you have to.
	return to the idea of low-res spritesheets
